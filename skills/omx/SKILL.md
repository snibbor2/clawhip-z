# Legacy wrapper helper note

This helper directory is no longer the recommended public workflow.

Use provider-native Codex or Claude hooks, keep project metadata in `.clawhip/project.json`,
and send local verification payloads through:

```bash
clawhip native hook --provider codex --file payload.json
clawhip native hook --provider claude --file payload.json
```

tmux monitoring remains available for keyword/stale alerts, but provider-native hook registration
is now the primary integration path.
